# IDS_Sensor


This is a project for intrusion detection in vehicular CAN buses to secure vehicular communication.

The step-by-step procedures to develop the intrusion detection system (IDS) using two different real vehicle datasets are given below: 

1. Please download the dataset (unzip_this_file.zip) from the source below: (We have uploaded the dataset to google drive due to the file size limit in GitHub)

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10o4npkG60guvac6vVdZdq2mHt5KdwWWP?usp=sharing

2. After downloading the zip file (unzip_this_file.zip), unzip it. Then copy the data set folders to "IDS_Sensor" folder in order to use data in the IDS code/algorithm provided in Github.

3. You will able to apply the dataset in python code/algorithm.

4. Dataset 1 (Kia Soul car dataset) has been used to develop an IDS to detect and classify attacks including DoS, fuzzy, impersonation, and attack-free state. The classifier model has been developed by using three machine-learning (ML) techniques including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). When Dataset 1 is used in our ML model,  the python file (dataset1_IDS_classification) is developed.

5. Once satisfactory outcomes have been achieved, then a totally new dataset, the dataset 2 (Chevrolet Spark car dataset) has been employed in the developed ML model to classify the attacks (fuzzy, flooding, malfunction attacks and attack free state) to evaluate the IDS performance. we have used dataset 2 in the same model (developed by dataset 1). In this case, please refer to the python code/algorithm file "dataset2_IDS_classification".

6. The performance of our IDS system using different ML classifiers for both datasets has been analyzed and compared. Please refer to the python code/algorithm "performance_comparison_analysis".

7. Each step of the code/algorithm to develop our IDS has been described in our code/algorithm by using a comment line. Please refer to these comment lines in each code that explains each and every process clearly.

8. If you have any questions, contact us via email.
